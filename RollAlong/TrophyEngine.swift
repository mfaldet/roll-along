//
//  S0-T3 — Trophy evaluation core (docs/trophies/sprint-plan.md §2 S0-T3;
//  design.md §4 Option C layer 1; trophy-catalog.md §6 items 1–2).
//
//  The engine is the ONLY writer of the trophy ledger, and the ledger is a
//  pure ratchet: a trophy latches exactly once, with a timestamp, forever.
//  Nothing here can revoke an unlock — not `resetProgress()`, not Sell Back
//  liquidation, not a regressed stat pushed back through `record`. Unlock
//  state is never re-derived from live stats (sprint-plan.md §4 addenda).
//
//  Hot-path contract (S0-T3 acceptance; S4-T2 budget <0.5ms p99 per bump —
//  `consumeLife`/`recordResult` fire mid-run):
//  • A stat bump evaluates ONLY the trophies interested in that metric —
//    one dictionary lookup into an index built once at init, then
//    O(interested trophies), never O(catalog).
//  • A bump that unlocks nothing performs ZERO UserDefaults writes and
//    ZERO `objectWillChange` emissions.
//  • Persistence is plist-native (the GameState `saveStringSet` pattern
//    for the id set; a String-keyed Date dictionary for timestamps) — no
//    JSON encoding anywhere, on or off the hot path.
//
//  Observability: trophy state lives in THIS ObservableObject — it is
//  deliberately NOT `@Published` on `GameState`, so gameplay views
//  observing GameState never re-render on trophy writes (S0-T3 acceptance;
//  §5 regression table). Only future trophy UI observes this object.
//
//  Value-push model: callers (GameState funnels, S1 wiring) push a
//  metric's CURRENT cumulative/latched value — never a delta. The engine
//  owns no stat bookkeeping (that is TrophyStats/GameState territory);
//  it only compares pushed values against catalog criteria and latches.
//  The single exception is the capstone's `base_trophies_unlocked`
//  metric, which the engine derives from its own ledger and refuses to
//  accept from outside.
//
//  Migration/backfill (first launch with trophies) is S0-T4 and lands in
//  this file next; offline-sync dirty-flagging is S1-T8.
//
//  Offline-safe recording (S1-T8, sprint-plan.md §2 S1-T8; catalog §6 item
//  17; internal-data-backend.md §7): unlock writes are already synchronous
//  UserDefaults at unlock time (see `persistLedger`), and progress snapshots
//  for UI are the monotonic `progressFraction(for:)` (S0-T3). The one piece
//  S1-T8 adds is the `ra_trophySyncDirty` flag — armed durably on EVERY
//  commit (live unlock AND backfill grant) and drained by S3-T3's
//  `TrophySyncService` via a FULL-SNAPSHOT upsert of every unlocked id
//  (internal-data-backend.md §7's self-healing pattern), NOT a fragile
//  per-event outbox. This engine only arms + exposes read/clear; it never
//  talks to the network and never routes through the memory-only
//  AnalyticsClient buffer.

///
/// • NEW S0-T2 counters that start empty: `daily_reward_claims`,
///   `coins_earned_from_play`, `no_fall_clear_streak_best`.
/// • Run/event metrics with no historical record: `first_try_aces`,
///   `spotless_runs`, `night_zen_sessions`, `level_one_falls`,
///   `starter_loadout_flexes`, `coinpit_round_stake_best`, `daily_played`.
/// • Social latches (all `socialAction` metrics) — no local pre-trophy state.
/// • `pinball_roll_lane_sweeps` — the ROLL lanes don't exist yet (§7).
/// • The capstone metric `base_trophies_unlocked` — engine-derived; the
///   cascade in `commit` completes it if the grandfathered base qualifies.
///
/// Cosmetics-OWNERSHIP counts (`balls_owned`, `cosmetics_owned`,
